 Nobody in my family’s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it’s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I’ve heard — I’ve learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough — I’m Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you
” said Hermione
 “Goodness, didn’t you know, I’d have found out everything I could if it was me,” said Hermione
 He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn’t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time
 Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they’d heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in
” He turned to Hermione
” “All right — I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,” said Hermione in a sniffy voice
 Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione
 No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she’d learned and wondering which one she’d need
 He heard Hermione whisper, “Its bewitched to look like the sky outside
 “Granger, Hermione
” On Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (“I do hope they start right away, there’s so much to learn, I’m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it’s supposed to be very difficult —”
 By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match
 Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile
 Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn’t a dunderhead
 Hermione’s hand had shot into the air
” He ignored Hermione’s hand
” Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn’t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was
 Snape was still ignoring Hermione’s quivering hand
” At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling
 “I think Hermione does, though, why don’t you try her
 “Sit down,” he snapped at Hermione
 Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was
 Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione’s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail
 Hermione Granger’s had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville’s hadn’t moved at all
” shouted Hermione Granger
 It was Hermione Granger
 Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry
 It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown
” “I almost told your brother,” Hermione snapped, “Percy — he’s a prefect, he’d put a stop to this
 Hermione wasn’t going to give up that easily
 Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting
 The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor tower
” They hadn’t even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them
” Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville
” Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward
 I — told — you,” Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, “I — told — you
” “Malfoy tricked you,” Hermione said to Harry
 “Oh, move over,” Hermione snarled
” Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again
 But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed
 Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor
 Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus
 Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry’s hand
” Hermione marched away with her nose in the air
 Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger
 It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this
 “You’re saying it wrong,” Harry heard Hermione snap
 Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, “Wingardium Leviosa
 It was Hermione
” Hermione didn’t turn up for the next class and wasn’t seen all afternoon
 On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls’ bathroom and wanted to be left alone
 Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds
 “I’ve just thought — Hermione
 “Hermione
 Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint
 The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione
” Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn’t move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror
 Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright
 It was Hermione who spoke first
” Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last
 Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher
” Hermione hung her head
 Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble
” Hermione left
 “Five, you mean, once she’s taken off Hermione’s
 Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them
 But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend
 It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend
 Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it
 Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view
 Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window
 Hermione was checking Harry and Ron’s Charms homework for them
 Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it
” Hermione’s eyes were wide
” “Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,” snapped Ron
” “Just a bit of toast,” wheedled Hermione
 Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row
 Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors
” Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join them
” At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid’s binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd
 “I knew it,” Hermione gasped, “Snape — look
 “He’s doing something — jinxing the broom,” said Hermione
” Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared
 “Come on, Hermione,” Ron muttered desperately
 Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind him
 He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid’s hut, with Ron and Hermione
 “It was Snape,” Ron was explaining, “Hermione and I saw him
” Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him
” cried Hermione
 “Just one,” said Hermione
” “We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that’s all,” said Hermione
 Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random
 He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they’d better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel
 Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads
” said Hermione
” “Very safe, as they’re both dentists,” said Hermione
 His next present also contained candy — a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione
 “I’ve heard of those,” he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he’d gotten from Hermione
” “You sound like Hermione
 Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things
… The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess
 Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her
 “Don’t play,” said Hermione at once
 “Pretend to break your leg,” Hermione suggested
 Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse
” Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron
” Hermione urged Neville
 Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas
 Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione
” Hermione jumped to her feet
” said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she’d looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself
 Hermione ignored him
” said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished
 “I’m going to play,” he told Ron and Hermione
” “Just as long as we’re not wiping you off the field,” said Hermione
 As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione
 Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they’d ever see him alive again
 Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn’t understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match
 Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse
 “Now, don’t forget, it’s Locomotor Mortis,” Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve
 “I’ve never seen Snape look so mean,” he told Hermione
 Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch
” said Hermione suddenly, “Harry —” “What
 Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet
” Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape — she didn’t even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle
” shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front
 Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed
” Hermione squeaked
” said Hermione in alarm
 Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside
 Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer’s Stone
 “Hermione, the exams are ages away
” “Ten weeks,” Hermione snapped
…” Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as Hermione
 It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon’s blood or practicing wand movements
” said Hermione thoughtfully
” said Hermione
” “Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here,” said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice
” Hermione went on
 Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione
” Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was
” said Hermione
” He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn’t
 Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too
 Hermione wouldn’t hear of it
 “Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching
 Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid’s with the other two during morning break
 “Hagrid,” said Hermione, “how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly
 Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy’s face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous
 Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed
 Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed
” Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down
 “It’ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,” said Hermione, but this didn’t soothe Ron at all
” Harry and Hermione didn’t get a chance to answer
 “It’s too late to change the plan now,” Harry told Hermione
 Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn’t come quickly enough
” Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves
 Hermione did a sort of jig
 They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they’d rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them
 They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much
 Hermione was trembling
” It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher’s question
” Hermione and Neville were suffering, too
 Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence
 He, Ron, and Hermione kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions
 Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy
 “If Quirrell’s told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell —” “There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione
” The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron’s eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could
” Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn’t
 The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table
 He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn’t say a word
 All right, Harry, Hermione
 “So me, Harry, an’ Hermione’ll go one way an’ Draco, Neville, an’ Fang’ll go the other
 A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right
 “You all right, Hermione
” Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak
 Harry and Hermione’s jaws dropped
 This is Harry Potter an’ Hermione Granger, by the way
 “We’d noticed,” said Hermione faintly
” “Erm —” “A bit,” said Hermione timidly
” Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view
” asked Hermione
 They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid’s arm
” whispered Hermione
 Right, we’re changin’ groups — Neville, you stay with me an’ Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an’ this idiot
” Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind her
 In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest
” Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort
 Maybe it was because they hadn’t seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn’t have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn’t seem as worried about the Stone as Harry
 “That was far easier than I thought it would be,” said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds
” Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree
” “Go to Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione suggested
 “Harry, relax, Hermione’s right, the Stone’s safe as long as Dumbledore’s around
 When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, “That’s just the exams
” panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up
” Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn’t speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds
 “We want to see Professor Dumbledore,” said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought
” “But what can we —” Hermione gasped
 Hermione, you’d better do that
’” “Oh, shut up,” said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape
” Harry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, “At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,” when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in
” said Hermione
 “You’re right Harry,” said Hermione in a small voice
” “Of course not,” said Hermione briskly
” “Not if I can help it,” said Hermione grimly
 Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break
 “No, no, no,” said Hermione
” Harry turned to Hermione
 Hermione stepped forward
 Hermione ran to turn him over
 “It’s the full Body-Bind,” said Hermione miserably
 “We’re coming,” said Hermione
” Hermione whispered
 “Want to go first, Hermione
” Hermione said anxiously
 Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep
 In the few seconds’silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep
 Come on, Hermione
 There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped
” shrieked Hermione
 Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her
” Hermione ordered them
” said Hermione
” Hermione cried, wringing her hands
” said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant
 “Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face
 They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn’t budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm
 “These birds…they can’t be here just for decoration,” said Hermione
 “Ron, you come at it from above — Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down and I’ll try and catch it
” Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it
 Ron and Hermione’s cheers echoed around the high chamber
 Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly – the towering white chessmen had no faces
” said Hermione nervously
” Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think
” “Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you next to him instead of that castle
 The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took
 “Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on
 Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger
” Harry and Hermione shouted
 She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor — Hermione screamed but stayed on her square — the white queen dragged Ron to one side
 With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway
” Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles
 Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing
 “Brilliant,” said Hermione
” “Of course not,” said Hermione
” Hermione read the paper several times
” Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line
” Hermione’s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him
 “Hermione
” said Hermione
” “Positive,” said Hermione
” Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire
 You got Hermione’s owl
” And she let Ron and Hermione in
” Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore
 Ron and Hermione were a very good audience
 they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell’s turban, Hermione screamed out loud
 “Well, I got back all right,” said Hermione
” “Well, ” Hermione exploded, “if he did — I mean to say that’s terrible — you could have been killed
 He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him
 “Second — to Miss Hermione Granger…for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points
” Hermione buried her face in her arms
 Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him
 Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years
 He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together
 Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione
” “Hope you have — er — a good holiday,” said Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant
