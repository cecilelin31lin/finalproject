 The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere
 they didn’t want Dudley mixing with a child like that
 Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair
 Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls
 Next Door’s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (“Won’t
 When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news: “And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation’s owls have been behaving very unusually today
 Instead he said, as casually as he could, “Their son — he’d be about Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t he
 Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley
 Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets — but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother
 “Nothing, nothing…” Dudley’s birthday — how could he have forgotten
 The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley’s birthday presents
 It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike
 Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course it involved punching somebody
 Dudley’s favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn’t often catch him
 He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley’s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was
 He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose
 Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother
 Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon
 Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel — Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig
 Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents
” “All right, thirty-seven then,” said Dudley, going red in the face
 Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over
 Is that all right” Dudley thought for a moment
” Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel
 ’Atta boy, Dudley
” He ruffled Dudley’s hair
 At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR
 Dudley’s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry’s heart gave a leap
 Every year on Dudley’s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies
 “You could just leave me here,” Harry put in hopefully (he’d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley’s computer)
…” Dudley began to cry loudly
” Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs
” said Aunt Petunia frantically — and a moment later, Dudley’s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother
 He was usually the one who held people’s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them
 Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once
 Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn’t believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys’ car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life
” Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses
 Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley’s (brown with orange puff balls)
 Dudley’s gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry’s surprise as anyone else’s, there he was sitting on the chimney
 It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn’t school, his cupboard, or Mrs
” Dudley and Piers sniggered
 The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop
 It wasn’t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn’t blond
 He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn’t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him
 They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn’t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first
 Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons
 Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place
 Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils
 “Do it again,” Dudley ordered
 “This is boring,” Dudley moaned
 The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling
” Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could
 What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened — one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror
 Piers and Dudley could only gibber
 As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death
 A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley
 Everybody knew that Dudley’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley’s gang
 By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs
 Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley’s gang, who visited the house every single day
 Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader
 The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley’s favorite sport: Harry Hunting
 When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn’t be with Dudley
 Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon’s old private school, Smeltings
 Dudley thought this was very funny
” Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he’d said
 One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs
 That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform
 As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life
 Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn’t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up
 “I’m dyeing some of Dudley’s old things gray for you
 Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry’s new uniform
 Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table
 “Get the mail, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper
” “Make Dudley get it
” “Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley
” said Dudley suddenly
 Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach
” They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room
 Dudley wasn’t used to being ignored
” demanded Dudley
” roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them
 Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole
 Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor
 Your aunt and I have been thinking…you’re really getting a bit big for it…we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley’s second bedroom
” The Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn’t fit into his first bedroom
 The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor’s dog
 in the corner was Dudley’s first-ever television set, which he’d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled
 there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it
 From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I don’t want him in there…I need that room…make him get out
 Dudley was in shock
 When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it
 Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind
 “Dudley — go — just go
” Dudley asked Harry in amazement
 When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut
 Dudley was sniffling in the back seat
 By nightfall Dudley was howling
 Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets
 Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering
” Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon
 Dudley sniveled
 If it was Monday — and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of television — then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry’s eleventh birthday
 Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa
 Dudley’s snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight
 The lighted dial of Dudley’s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he’d be eleven in ten minutes’ time
twenty…ten… nine — maybe he’d wake Dudley up, just to annoy him — three…two…one… BOOM
 Dudley jerked awake
 …” He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear
 Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon
 Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little
 Uncle Vernon said sharply, “Don’t touch anything he gives you, Dudley
 He’d spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon
 If he’d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football
 Now he came to think about it…every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry…chased by Dudley’s gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach…dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he’d managed to make it grow back
and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn’t he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it
” He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley — there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain
 Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them
 He didn’t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he’d had in his whole life — more money than even Dudley had ever had
” Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley
 Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these
 “I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley
 True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn’t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn’t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him — in fact, they didn’t speak to him at all
 He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room
 “Taking Dudley to the hospital,” growled Uncle Vernon
 Two hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off
 After all, he’d never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley’s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents
 He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him
 Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick
 HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone CHAPTER NINE THE MIDNIGHT DUEL H arry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy
 Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry
 I’m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer
