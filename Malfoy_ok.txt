 “And my name’s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy
 Draco Malfoy looked at him
 Draco Malfoy didn’t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks
” Malfoy sneered
 Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle’s knuckle — Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once
 “You’ve met Malfoy before
 He says Malfoy’s father didn’t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side
” Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, “SLYTHERIN
” Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself
 He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn’t look too pleased with the seating arrangements
 he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it — then Malfoy turned into the hooknosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold — there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking
” Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands
 He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter
 He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like
 He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon
 HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone CHAPTER NINE THE MIDNIGHT DUEL H arry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy
 Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn’t have to put up with Malfoy much
 To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy
 “Anyway, I know Malfoy’s always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that’s all talk
” Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot
 Harry hadn’t had a single letter since Hagrid’s note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course
 Malfoy’s eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table
” Neville was trying to remember what he’d forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand
 They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash
” “Malfoy’s got my Remembrall, Professor
” Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table
 Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he’d been doing it wrong for years
 No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter
 “Shut up, Malfoy,” snapped Parvati Patil
” said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass
 “Give that here, Malfoy,” said Harry quietly
 Malfoy smiled nastily
” Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off
 He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair
 Malfoy looked stunned
” said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried
 He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfoy like a javelin
 Malfoy only just got out of the way in time
 “No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,” Harry called
 The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy
 “Never — in all my time at Hogwarts —” Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, “— how dare you — might have broken your neck —” “It wasn’t his fault, Professor —” “Be quiet, Miss Patil —” “But Malfoy —” “That’s enough, Mr
” Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall’s wake as she strode toward the castle
” Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle
 “I’d take you on anytime on my own,” said Malfoy
” Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up
” When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other
 The most you and Malfoy’ll be able to do is send sparks at each other
 “I couldn’t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying —” “Bet you could,” Ron muttered
 On the other hand, Malfoy’s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness — this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face
 Malfoy and Crabbe weren’t there yet
 Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once
 Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak — and it wasn’t Malfoy
” “Malfoy tricked you,” Hermione said to Harry
 He was never going to meet you — Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off
 All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later
 Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it
 What did you say you’ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty
” “What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn’t afford half the handle,” Malfoy snapped back
” Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy’s elbow
 “Potter’s been sent a broomstick, Professor,” said Malfoy quickly
” “A Nimbus Two Thousand, it is,” said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy’s face
 “And it’s really thanks to Malfoy here that I’ve got it,” he added
 Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy’s obvious rage and confusion
 “I do feel so sorry,” said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, “for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they’re not wanted at home
 Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match
 So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family
” came Malfoy’s cold drawl from behind them
” Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs
” Ron let go of the front of Malfoy’s robes
 “Malfoy was insultin’ his family
” Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking
 “I’ll get him,” said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy’s back, “one of these days, I’ll get him —” “I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape
 They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork — bread, English muffins, marshmallows — and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn’t work
 “Malfoy,” said Neville shakily
” “There’s no need to tell me I’m not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy’s already done that,” Neville choked out
 “You’re worth twelve of Malfoy,” Harry said
 And where’s Malfoy
 They’d gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry
 It was Malfoy
” Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle
” said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all
” Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy
 “I’m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,” he stammered
 Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, “You tell him, Neville
 “I’m warning you, Malfoy — one more word—” “Ron
” said Malfoy
 Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground
” Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape — she didn’t even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle
 “And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed
 Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen
 Harry didn’t like the look on Malfoy’s face at all
 Malfoy had seen the dragon
 Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy’s face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous
 Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment
 Anything to get rid of Norbert — and Malfoy
 Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me
 “Oh no oh no — I’ve just remembered — Charlie’s letter was in that book Malfoy took, he’s going to know we’re getting rid of Norbert
 And we have got the invisibility cloak, Malfoy doesn’t know about that
 Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear
 Come on — I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy
 “Malfoy’s got detention
 Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his crate
 No more dragon — Malfoy in detention — what could spoil their happiness
 “I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he said you had a drag—” Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall had seen
 You fed Draco Malfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into trouble
 Filch was already there — and so was Malfoy
 Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too
” At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks
 Malfoy now turned to Hagrid
” Malfoy didn’t move
” said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his voice
” “I want Fang,” said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang’s long teeth
 A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right
 “I don’t care if Malfoy has, but if something’s got Neville…it’s our fault he’s here in the first place
 Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with him
 Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke
” So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang
 “Look —” he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy
 Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed
” Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted — so did Fang
 Malfoy
 Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table
 Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn’t have looked more stunned and horrified if he’d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him
