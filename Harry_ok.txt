 “The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard —” “ — yes, their son, Harry —” Mr
 He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry
 Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew was called Harry
” “Harry
 They’re saying he tried to kill the Potter’s son, Harry
 No one knows why, or how, but they’re saying that when he couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why he’s gone
 It’s just astounding…of all the things to stop him…but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive
” “I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle
 Harry Potter come and live here
 He’ll be famous — a legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future — there will be books written about Harry — every child in our world will know his name
” She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it
” Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys’ house
 He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss
 “But I c-c-can’t stand it —Lily an’James dead — an’ poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles —” “Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door
 He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry’s blankets, and then came back to the other two
 “Good luck, Harry,” he murmured
 Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up
He couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived
” HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone CHAPTER TWO THE VANISHING GLASS N early ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all
 Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long
” Harry woke with a start
 Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove
 “Nearly,” said Harry
” Harry groaned
 Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks
 Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept
 Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course it involved punching somebody
 Dudley’s favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn’t often catch him
 Harry didn’t look it, but he was very fast
 Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age
 Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes
 The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning
 Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon
 About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut
 Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way — all over the place
 Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother
 Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel — Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig
 Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn’t much room
 Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over
 At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR
” She jerked her head in Harry’s direction
 Dudley’s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry’s heart gave a leap
 Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs
 Harry hated it there
” said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he’d planned this
 Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs
” The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn’t there — or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn’t understand them, like a slug
 “You could just leave me here,” Harry put in hopefully (he’d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley’s computer)
 “I won’t blow up the house,” said Harry, but they weren’t listening
” He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother’s arms
 Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn’t believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys’ car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life
 His aunt and uncle hadn’t been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they’d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside
 “I’m warning you,” he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry’s, “I’m warning you now, boy — any funny business, anything at all — and you’ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas
” “I’m not going to do anything,” said Harry, “honestly…” But Uncle Vernon didn’t believe him
 The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn’t make them happen
 Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn’t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left “to hide that horrible scar
” Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses
 The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn’t fit Harry
 Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn’t punished
 Dudley’s gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry’s surprise as anyone else’s, there he was sitting on the chimney
 The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry’s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings
 Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump
 He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects
 “I had a dream about a motorcycle,” said Harry, remembering suddenly
 He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: “MOTORCYCLES DON’T FLY
 “I know they don’t,” said Harry
 The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop
 It wasn’t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn’t blond
 Harry had the best morning he’d had in a long time
 They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn’t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first
 Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last
 Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake
 Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry’s
 Harry stared
 It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: “I get that all the time
” “I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn’t sure the snake could hear him
” Harry asked
 Harry peered at it
” The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo
” As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump
 “Out of the way, you,” he said, punching Harry in the ribs
 Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor
 Harry sat up and gasped
 As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, “Brazil, here I come
 As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death
 But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, “Harry was talking to it, weren’t you, Harry
” Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry
 Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch
 When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened
 After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything
 The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look
 At school, Harry had no one
 Everybody knew that Dudley’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley’s gang
 HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone CHAPTER THREE LETTERS FROM NO ONE T he escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment
 Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley’s gang, who visited the house every single day
 The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley’s favorite sport: Harry Hunting
 This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope
 Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school
 “They stuff people’s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,” he told Harry
” “No, thanks,” said Harry
 One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs
 She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she’d had it for several years
 Harry didn’t trust himself to speak
 * * * There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast
 Harry looked in the bowl again
” Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue
 Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry’s new uniform
 “Make Harry get it
” “Get the mail, Harry
” Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail
 Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon’s sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and — a letter for Harry
 Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band
 Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms
 Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter
 “Dad, Harry’s got something
” Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon
” said Harry, trying to snatch it back
” They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room
 “I want to read it,” said Harry furiously, “as it’s mine
 Harry didn’t move
” roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them
 Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole
 Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor
 Tell them we don’t want —” Harry could see Uncle Vernon’s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen
 he visited Harry in his cupboard
” said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door
” “It was not a mistake,” said Harry angrily, “it had my cupboard on it
 “Er — yes, Harry — about this cupboard
” said Harry
 It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room
” Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed
 Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he’d opened the letter in the hall
 When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it
 Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive —’” With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him
 Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind
 After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry’s letter clutched in his hand
 “Go to your cupboard — I mean, your bedroom,” he wheezed at Harry
” Harry walked round and round his new room
 Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently
” Harry leapt into the air
 Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle’s face
 Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn’t do exactly what he’d been trying to do
 He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea
 Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon’s lap
 Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink
 On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry
 Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window
” Dudley asked Harry in amazement
 The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one — “Out
” Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall
 Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets
 Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering
 Potter Room 17 Railview Hotel Cokeworth Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way
 This reminded Harry of something
 If it was Monday — and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of television — then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry’s eleventh birthday
 Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn’t cheer him up at all
 She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket
 Harry couldn’t sleep
 The lighted dial of Dudley’s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he’d be eleven in ten minutes’ time
 Harry heard something creak outside
 The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door
 HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone CHAPTER FOUR THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS B OOM
 “An’ here’s Harry
 Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile
 “Anyway — Harry,” said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, “a very happy birthday to yeh
 Harry opened it with trembling fingers
 Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing
 Harry looked up at the giant
” He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s whole arm
 It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he’d sunk into a hot bath
” He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn’t take his eyes off the giant
 “Er — no,” said Harry
 “Sorry,” Harry said quickly
” asked Harry
” Harry thought this was going a bit far
” Hagrid stared wildly at Harry
” Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare
” said Harry eagerly
 “Harry — yer a wizard
” gasped Harry
” Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr
 Yours sincerely, Minerva McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress Questions exploded inside Harry’s head like fireworks and he couldn’t decide which to ask first
 With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: Dear Professor Dumbledore, Given Harry his letter
 Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly
” said Harry, interested
” said Harry
” Harry had gone very white
 Harry Potter not knowin’ his own story when every kid in our world knows his name
” Harry asked urgently
 Ah, Harry, I don’ know if I’m the right person ter tell yeh — but someone’s gotta — yeh can’t go off ter Hogwarts not knowin’
” “Gulpin’ gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared
” Harry suggested
 Dark days, Harry
 That’s what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh — took care of yer mum an’ dad an’ yer house, even — but it didn’t work on you, an’ that’s why yer famous, Harry
” Something very painful was going on in Harry’s mind
 Harry jumped
 Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them
” “Good question, Harry
 ’Cause somethin’ about you finished him, Harry
” Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake
” Harry looked into the fire
 Now he came to think about it…every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry…chased by Dudley’s gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach…dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he’d managed to make it grow back
 Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him
 “Harry Potter, not a wizard — you wait, you’ll be right famous at Hogwarts
 When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig’s tail poking through a hole in his trousers
” He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows
” asked Harry
” He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry
” HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone CHAPTER FIVE DIAGON ALLEY H arry woke early the next morning
 And there’s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart sinking
 “All right,” Harry mumbled, “I’m getting up
 Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him
” Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat
” said Harry loudly
finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins
” Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it
 “Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an’ buy all yer stuff fer school
” Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them
” Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding
 Never mess with goblins, Harry
” Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock
” Harry asked, looking around for another boat
” They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying
 “Seems a shame ter row, though,” said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks
” “Of course not,” said Harry, eager to see more magic
” Harry asked
” Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet
 Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he’d never had so many questions in his life
” Harry asked, before he could stop himself
 Blimey, Harry, everyone’d be wantin’ magic solutions to their problems
 Harry couldn’t blame them
 Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, “See that, Harry
” “Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, “did you say there are dragons at Gringotts
 Hagrid, who didn’t understand “Muggle money,” as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets
 “Still got yer letter, Harry
 Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket
” Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn’t noticed the night before, and read: HOGWARTS SCHOOL o f WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY UNIFORM First-year students will require: 1
” Harry wondered aloud
 Harry had never been to London before
 all Harry had to do was keep close behind him
 If Harry hadn’t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so
 yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn’t help trusting him
 If Hagrid hadn’t pointed it out, Harry wouldn’t have noticed it was there
 In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it
” “Can’t, Tom, I’m on Hogwarts business,” said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry’s shoulder and making Harry’s knees buckle
 “Good Lord,” said the bartender, peering at Harry, “is this — can this be —
 “Bless my soul,” whispered the old bartender, “Harry Potter…what an honor
” He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes
” Harry didn’t know what to say
 Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron
” said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle’s top hat fell off in his excitement
” Harry shook hands again and again — Doris Crockford kept coming back for more
 “Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts
” “P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry’s hand, “ccan’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you
 But the others wouldn’t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself
 Come on, Harry
” Doris Crockford shook Harry’s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds
 Hagrid grinned at Harry
 Harry’s head was swimming
 “Right, stand back, Harry
” He grinned at Harry’s amazement
 Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall
” Harry wished he had about eight more eyes
 Several boys of about Harry’s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it
 “Look,” Harry heard one of them say, “the new Nimbus Two Thousand — fastest ever —” There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels’ eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon
 The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry
 He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet
 Hagrid and Harry made for the counter
 Harry Potter’s safe
 Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals
 Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall
” Harry asked
 Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised
 Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible
 Harry’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open
 “I never know,” Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, “what’s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite
 A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped
 All Harry’s — it was incredible
 How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep
 Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag
 They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck
” Harry asked
 Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least — but at first he thought it was empty
 Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask
 Harry didn’t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money
 “Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron
” He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin’s shop alone, feeling nervous
” she said, when Harry started to speak
 Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length
” “Yes,” said Harry
” Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley
 “No,” said Harry
” “No,” Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be
” “No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute
” “Mmm,” said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting
 Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn’t come in
 “That’s Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn’t
” “He’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry
” “I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly
” “They’re dead,” said Harry shortly
” But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, “That’s you done, my dear,” and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool
 Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts)
 “Nothing,” Harry lied
 Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote
” “Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin’ how little yeh know — not knowin’ about Quidditch
” “Don’t make me feel worse,” said Harry
 Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o’ duffers, but —” “I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,” said Harry gloomily
 They bought Harry’s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather
 Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian
” Hagrid wouldn’t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (“It says pewter on yer list”), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope
 While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop)
 Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry’s list again
” Harry felt himself go red
 Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing
” A magic wand…this was what Harry had been really looking forward to
 Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library
 Harry jumped
 “Hello,” said Harry awkwardly
 Harry Potter
 Ollivander moved closer to Harry
 Harry wished he would blink
 Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose
 Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes
 Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead with a long, white finger
 …” He shook his head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted Hagrid
 Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke
” “Er — well, I’m right-handed,” said Harry
” He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head
” Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own
” Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr
 Try —” Harry tried — but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr
” Harry tried
” Harry took the wand
 Well, well, well…how curious…how very curious…” He put Harry’s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, “Curious…curious… “Sorry,” said Harry, “but what’s curious
 Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare
” Harry swallowed
” Harry shivered
 The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty
 Harry didn’t speak at all as they walked down the road
 he didn’t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry’s lap
 Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder
 He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them
 Harry kept looking around
 “You all right, Harry
 Harry wasn’t sure he could explain
 “Don’ you worry, Harry
” Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope
See yeh soon, Harry
 Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight
 HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone CHAPTER SIX THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS H arry’s last month with the Dursleys wasn’t fun
 True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn’t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn’t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him — in fact, they didn’t speak to him at all
 Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty
 Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company
 Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first
 Harry supposed that meant yes
” Harry didn’t say anything
” “I don’t know,” said Harry, realizing this for the first time
” Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly
” Harry woke at five o’clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep
 Two hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off
 Uncle Vernon dumped Harry’s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him
 Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face
 Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away
 Harry’s mouth went rather dry
 The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn’t even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose
 Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o’clock, but the guard said there wasn’t one
 Harry was now trying hard not to panic
 “— packed with Muggles, of course —” Harry swung round
 Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry’s in front of him — and they had an owl
 Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them
 Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it — but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished
 “Excuse me,” Harry said to the plump woman
 “Yes,” said Harry
” she said kindly, and Harry nodded
” “Er — okay,” said Harry
 Harry walked more quickly
 Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it, He had done it
 Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat
 Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train
 “Yes, please,” Harry panted
” With the twins’ help, Harry’s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment
 “Thanks,” said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes
” said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry’s lightning scar
” he added to Harry
” said Harry
 “Harry Potter
 “Oh, him,” said Harry
” The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red
” With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train
 Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying
 He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his chest with the letter P on it
” Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn’t see him looking
” “Harry Potter
” Harry heard the little girl’s voice
 Harry saw the boys’ mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved
 Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner
 Harry felt a great leap of excitement
” he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry
” Harry shook his head and the boy sat down
 He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn’t looked
 Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose
 “Harry,” said the other twin, “did we introduce ourselves
” “Bye,” said Harry and Ron
 “Are you really Harry Potter
 Harry nodded
 “And have you really got — you know…” He pointed at Harry’s forehead
 Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar
” “Yes,” said Harry, “but I can’t remember it
 He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again
” asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him
 Harry didn’t think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl
” said Harry
 “I’d have thought you, of all people —” “I’m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,” said Harry, “I just never knew you shouldn’t
” Harry, who hadn’t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron’s ears went pink again and he muttered that he’d brought sandwiches
 Harry went out into the corridor
 Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life
 Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat
” “Starving,” said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty
” “Swap you for one of these,” said Harry, holding up a pasty
” “Go on, have a pasty,” said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with
 It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry’s pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten)
” Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs
” Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card
” said Harry
 I might get Agrippa — thanks —” Harry turned over his card and read: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS C onsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel
 Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore’s face had disappeared
 “Help yourself,” said Harry
” Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile
 Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn’t keep his eyes off them
 “You want to be careful with those,” Ron warned Harry
 Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn’t touch, which turned out to be pepper
 There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and three-quarters came in
” “He’ll turn up,” said Harry
 Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn’t learned all the course books by heart either
 “Harry Potter,” said Harry
” said Harry, feeling dazed
” asked Harry
 “You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are a bit lighter,” said Harry, trying to take Ron’s mind off houses
” Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he’d finished school
” Harry stared
” Harry turned this news over in his mind
” Harry confessed
 He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn’t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time
 Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop
 He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he’d shown back in Diagon Alley
 “They’re saying all down the train that Harry Potter’s in this compartment
” “Yes,” said Harry
 “Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,” said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking
” He turned back to Harry
” He held out his hand to shake Harry’s, but Harry didn’t take it
” Both Harry and Ron stood up
 “Unless you get out now,” said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron
 “I think he’s been knocked out,” Ron said to Harry
” Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley
 Harry peered out of the window
” Harry’s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles
 Harry shivered in the cold night air
 Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: “Firs’ years
 All right there, Harry
 It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there
 Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione
 HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone CHAPTER SEVEN THE SORTING HAT T he door swung open at once
 She had a very stern face and Harry’s first thought was that this was not someone to cross
 Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right — the rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall
 Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair
 Harry swallowed
” Harry’s heart gave a horrible jolt
 Harry tried hard not to listen to her
” Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall
 Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place
 Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars
 Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years
 Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing — noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too
” Ron whispered to Harry
” Harry
 Harry didn’t feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment
 Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her
 Harry could see Ron’s twin brothers catcalling
 Perhaps it was Harry’s imagination, after all he’d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot
” Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide
 “Finnigan, Seamus,” the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor
 A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you’re very nervous
 “Moon”…, “Nott”…, “Parkinson”…, then a pair of twin girls, “Patil” and “Patil”…, then “Perks, Sally-Anne”…, and then, at last — “Potter, Harry
” As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall
” “The Harry Potter
” The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him
” Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin
” Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall
” Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he’d seen earlier
 The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he’d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water
 Harry grinned back
 Harry recognized him at once from the card he’d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train
 Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron
 “Thomas, Dean,” a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table
 Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, “GRYFFINDOR
” Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him
 “Well done, Ron, excellent,” said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as “Zabini, Blaise,” was made a Slytherin
 Harry looked down at his empty gold plate
 Harry didn’t know whether to laugh or not
 Potatoes, Harry
” Harry’s mouth fell open
 The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he’d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked
 Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick
 Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat
 “That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak
” Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood
 He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn’t look too pleased with the seating arrangements
 Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding… As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families
” On Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (“I do hope they start right away, there’s so much to learn, I’m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it’s supposed to be very difficult —”
 Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again
 The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry’s forehead
” Harry clapped a hand to his head
 Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher’s look — a feeling that he didn’t like Harry at all
” Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t look at him again
” Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did
 Harry noticed that the other teachers’ smiles had become rather fixed
 Harry’s legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food
 They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt
” Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings
” Harry was going to ask Ron if he’d had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once
 Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream
 Harry told the turban he didn’t want to be in Slytherin
 he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it — then Malfoy turned into the hooknosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold — there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking
 HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone CHAPTER EIGHT THE POTIONS MASTER T here, look
” Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day
 Harry wished they wouldn’t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes
 The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk
 Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning
 There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words
 At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry’s name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight
 Harry had been quite right to think she wasn’t a teacher to cross
 Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn’t miles behind everyone else
 Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron
” Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge
” “Wish McGonagall favored us,” said Harry
 Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps
 Hedwig hadn’t brought Harry anything so far
 This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry’s plate
 Harry tore it open at once
 It said, in a very untidy scrawl: Dear Harry, I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three
 Hagrid Harry borrowed Ron’s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again
 It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far
 At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him
 Snape didn’t dislike Harry — he hated him
 Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry’s name
 “Ah, Yes,” he said softly, “Harry Potter
 Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows
 Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was
 “I don’t know, sir,” said Harry
” Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn’t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was
” Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes
 “I don’t know,” said Harry quietly
 Harry caught Seamus’s eye, and Seamus winked
 Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville
” This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron
” As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry’s mind was racing and his spirits were low
 When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks
 “This is Ron,” Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate
” The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons
 Fang rested his head on Harry’s knee and drooled all over his robes
 Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch “that old git
” Harry told Hagrid about Snape’s lesson
 Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students
” Yet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t quite meet his eyes when he said that
” Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose
 While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie’s work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy
 Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn’t mentioned the date
” said Harry, “that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday
” There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn’t meet Harry’s eyes this time
 Harry read the story again
 As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they’d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he’d had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid
 And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn’t want to tell Harry
 HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone CHAPTER NINE THE MIDNIGHT DUEL H arry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy
 “Typical,” said Harry darkly
 Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean’s poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move
 Privately, Harry felt she’d had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground
 Harry hadn’t had a single letter since Hagrid’s note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course
 Harry and Ron jumped to their feet
 At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson
 Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left
” Harry glanced down at his broom
 Harry’s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did
 Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry
 Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he’d been doing it wrong for years
 Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and — WHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap
 “Broken wrist,” Harry heard her mutter
 “Give that here, Malfoy,” said Harry quietly
” Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off
” Harry grabbed his broom
” Harry ignored her
 “Give it here,” Harry called, “or I’ll knock you off that broom
 Harry knew, somehow, what to do
 Harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady
 “No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,” Harry called
 Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall
” Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall’s wake as she strode toward the castle
 She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her
 thought Harry, bewildered
 “Follow me, you two,” said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry
” Harry nodded silently
 “He’s just the build for a Seeker, too,” said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him
…” Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry
 Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he’d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall
 “But first years never — you must be the youngest house player in about —” “ — a century,” said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth
” Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry
 “I start training next week,” said Harry
” Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over
 You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us
” “You’re a lot braver now that you’re back on the ground and you’ve got your little friends with you,” said Harry coolly
” When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other
” said Harry
 Catching the look on Harry’s face, he added quickly, “But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards
 Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry
” “And it’s really none of your business,” said Harry
 All the same, it wasn’t what you’d call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn’t back from the hospital wing)
 Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today
 They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, “I can’t believe you’re going to do this, Harry
” Harry couldn’t believe anyone could be so interfering
” said Harry sharply
” said Harry
” Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward
 At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs
 Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once
 Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak — and it wasn’t Malfoy
 Horror-struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible
” Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor
” Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following — they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going — they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room
 “I think we’ve lost him,” Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead
” “Malfoy tricked you,” Hermione said to Harry
” Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn’t going to tell her that
 She grabbed Harry’s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, “Alohomora
 “He thinks this door is locked,” Harry whispered
” For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry’s bathrobe for the last minute
” Harry turned around — and saw, quite clearly, what
 It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren’t already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant
 Harry groped for the doorknob — between Filch and death, he’d take Filch
 They fell backward — Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor
 “Never mind that — pig snout, pig snout,” panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward
” Harry suggested
 But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed
 It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was
 HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone CHAPTER TEN HALLOWEEN M alfoy couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful
 Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one
 In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection
 “Or both,” said Harry
 Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus
 Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor
 Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said: DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE
 Professor McGonagall Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read
 Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it
 “That’s a broomstick,” he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face
” Ron grinned at Harry
 “Yes, yes, that’s right,” said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry
” “A Nimbus Two Thousand, it is,” said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy’s face
 Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy’s obvious rage and confusion
 “Well, it’s true,” Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, “If he hadn’t stolen Neville’s Remembrall I wouldn’t be on the team
 Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry’s hand
” said Harry
 Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day
 “Wow,” Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry’s bedspread
 Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful
 As seven o’clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field
 They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high
 Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground
 Harry landed next to him
” “Three Chasers,” Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball
” “The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,” Harry recited
 “Never mind,” said Harry quickly
” “Three Chasers, one Keeper,” said Harry, who was determined to remember it all
” He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat
” He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle
 Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box
 “Stand back,” Wood warned Harry
 At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry’s face
 Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air — it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground
 the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,” Harry reeled off
” Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand
” Harry shook his head
” He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch
 Harry didn’t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted
” Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he’d already been at Hogwarts two months
 Harry’s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye)
 She hadn’t spoken to either of them since the day Harry’s broomstick had arrived
 Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop
 Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it — Harry had to put it out with his hat
 “You’re saying it wrong,” Harry heard Hermione snap
 “It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, “she’s a nightmare, honestly
” Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him
 Harry caught a glimpse of her face — and was startled to see that she was in tears
 On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls’ bathroom and wanted to be left alone
 Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face
” Harry asked as they climbed the stairs
 As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron’s arm
” hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin
” Harry whispered
 “He’s heading for the third floor,” Harry said, but Ron held up his hand
” Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean
 “The keys in the lock,” Harry muttered
 With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it
” Harry gasped
 Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside
” Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall
 Its mean little eyes saw Harry
 The troll didn’t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it
” Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn’t move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror
 Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll’s neck from behind
 The troll couldn’t feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry’s wand had still been in his hand when he’d jumped – it had gone straight up one of the troll’s nostrils
 Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life
 Harry got to his feet
” “I don’t think so,” said Harry, I think it’s just been knocked out
 Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry
 Harry had never seen her look so angry
 Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry’s mind
 Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air
” Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look
 Harry looked at the floor
 Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club
” Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn’t new to them
 Harry was speechless
 Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron
” “She might not have needed saving if we hadn’t locked the thing in with her,” Harry reminded him
 HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone CHAPTER ELEVEN QUIDDITCH A s they entered November, the weather turned very cold
 On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin
 Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret
 But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn’t know which was worse — people telling him he’d be brilliant or people telling him they’d be running around underneath him holding a mattress
 It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend
 Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473
 Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it
 The day before Harry’s first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar
 Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping
 Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view
 Harry showed him
” “He’s just made that rule up,” Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away
 Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window
 Hermione was checking Harry and Ron’s Charms homework for them
 Harry felt restless
 “Better you than me,” they said together, but Harry had an idea that Snape wouldn’t refuse if there were other teachers listening
” Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but — “POTTER
 Harry gulped
” Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor
” Ron asked as Harry joined them
” In a low whisper, Harry told them what he’d seen
 “I’m with Harry
” Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question
 Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn’t sleep
 He tried to empty his mind — he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours – but the expression on Snape’s face when Harry had seen his leg wasn’t easy to forget
” Harry felt terrible
 “Harry, you need your strength,” said Seamus Finnigan
” “Thanks, Seamus,” said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his sausages
 As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined
 Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green)
 “We know Oliver’s speech by heart,” Fred told Harry, “we were on the team last year
” Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his knees weren’t going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers
 Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year
 Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him
” Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand
 “Harry hasn’t had much to do yet
” “Kept outta trouble, though, that’s somethin’,” said Hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry
 Way up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for some sign of the Snitch
” When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to let off his feelings
 Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys’ wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it
 “All right there, Harry
 Harry saw it
 Harry was faster than Higgs — he could see the little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead — he put on an extra spurt of speed — WHAM
 A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below — Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry’s broom spun off course, Harry holding on for dear life
 Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air
” It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened
 Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal-posts — he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out — and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control
 No one seemed to have noticed that Harry’s broom was behaving strangely
 “Dunno what Harry thinks he’s doing,” Hagrid mumbled
…” Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands
 Harry’s broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it
” At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid’s binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd
 He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath
 Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry
 The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good – every time they got near him, the broom would jump higher still
 Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom
 Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick — he hit the field on all fours — coughed — and something gold fell into his hand
 “He didn’t catch it, he nearly swallowed it,” Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference — Harry hadn’t broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results — Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty
 Harry heard none of this, though
” Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him
 Harry decided on the truth
” said Harry eagerly
” “So why did he just try and kill Harry
 “I don’ know why Harry’s broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn’ try an’ kill a student
” said Harry, “so there’s someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there
 HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone CHAPTER TWELVE THE MIRROR OF ERISED C hristmas was coming
” He was looking over at Harry as he spoke
 Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them
 Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a widemouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next
 Then he’d realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick
 So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family
 It was true that Harry wasn’t going back to Privet Drive for Christmas
 Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once
 “I’ll get him,” said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy’s back, “one of these days, I’ll get him —” “I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape
 “And that reminds me — Harry, Ron, we’ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library
” “Oh, we’re not working,” Harry told him brightly
” Harry added
 Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section
” “Nothing,” said Harry
” Wishing he’d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the library
 Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn’t very hopeful
 Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel
 Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess
 Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn’t trust him at all
” On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all
 “Merry Christmas,” said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe
 “You, too,” said Harry
” said Ron, turning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry’s
 Harry picked up the top parcel
 It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid
 Harry blew it — it sounded a bit like an owl
 “That’s friendly,” said Harry
” “You can keep it,” said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was
” Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge
” “That’s really nice of her,” said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty
 Harry picked it up and felt it
” Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor
” Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell
” Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone
” Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter
 Harry stared at the note
” “Nothing,” said Harry
 Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight
” “Hey, look — Harry’s got a Weasley sweater, too
 “Harry’s is better than ours, though,” said Fred, holding up Harry’s sweater
 Get it on, Percy, come on, we’re all wearing ours, even Harry got one
 Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner
 Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn’t just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral’s hat and several live, white mice
 Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry’s amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided
 When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set
 The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs
 Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds
 Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron
 It had been Harry’s best Christmas day ever
 Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it
 Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake
 Should Harry wake him
 Harry said nothing
 Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books
 The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps
 Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn’t understand
 The hairs on the back of Harry’s neck prickled
 Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note
 Filch’s pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch’s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book’s shrieks still ringing in his ears
” Harry felt the blood drain out of his face
” Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead
 They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away
 His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again
 Harry looked over his shoulder — but still, no one was there
 She had dark red hair and her eyes — her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass
 It stuck up at the back, just as Harry’s did
 Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection
 And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry’s knobbly knees — Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life
 The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them
” Harry couldn’t eat
” What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again
 They tried retracing Harry’s route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour
” Harry hissed
 just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor
 Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror
” Harry whispered
” Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn’t see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas
” Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry
 Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing — did the cloak work on cats
” And Ron pulled Harry out of the room
 “Want to play chess, Harry
” “No…you go…” “I know what you’re thinking about, Harry, that mirror
” “I’m serious, Harry, don’t go
” But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn’t going to stop him
 Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror
 Except — “So — back again, Harry
” Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice
 Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn’t noticed him
” “Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling
 “So,” said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, “you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised
” Harry shook his head
” Harry thought
 “The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again
” Harry stood up
” Harry stared
” It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful
 HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone CHAPTER THIRTEEN NICHOLAS FLAMEL D umbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk
 Harry wished he could forget what he’d seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn’t
 “You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,” said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams
 She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (“If Filch had caught you
 They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book, even though Harry was still sure he’d read the name somewhere
 Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again
 The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood’s side
 Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training
” Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch
… The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess
 Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her
 “Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harry sat down next to him, “I need to concen—” He caught sight of Harry’s face
” Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape’s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee
 “I can’t,” said Harry
” Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron
 Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas
 “You’re worth twelve of Malfoy,” Harry said
 “Thanks, Harry…I think I’ll go to bed
” As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card
 Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms
” said Harry and Ron
” She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer’s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers
” said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished
” said Harry
” The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they’d do with a Sorcerer’s Stone if they had one
 It wasn’t until Ron said he’d buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match
 As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione
 Harry didn’t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went
 Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry
 Harry didn’t see how he could — yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds
 Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they’d ever see him alive again
 Harry hardly heard a word of Wood’s pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand
 Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse
 They’d gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry
” Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside
” Harry’s heart did a somersault
 Harry could have laughed out loud with relief He was safe
 Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch
” Ron’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry
” said Hermione suddenly, “Harry —” “What
” Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd
 Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet
 “Come on, Harry
” Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape — she didn’t even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle
 Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches — the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand
 Harry’s won
 Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground
 As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped — then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore’s smiling face
 “Well done,” said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear
 Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed
 Harry had reached the shed
 Harry’s victory faded from his mind as he watched
 Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off
 Harry couldn’t make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever
 Harry strained to catch what they were saying
” Harry leaned forward
” An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree
 It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified
 “Harry, where have you been
” shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back
” “Never mind that now,” said Harry breathlessly
 HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone CHAPTER FOURTEEN NORBERT THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK Q uirrell, however, must have been braver than they’d thought
 Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside
 Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell’s stutter
 Harry and Ron wouldn’t have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same
 Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work
 Harry, who was looking up “Dittany” in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn’t look up until he heard Ron say, “Hagrid
” “There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,” said Harry, “about what’s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy —” “SHHHH
 They’ll think I’ve told yeh —” “See you later, then,” said Harry
” “Hagrid’s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him, “ said Harry
” said Harry
” “Yes,” said Harry
 Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione
” Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was
” said Harry anxiously
 “Well, that’s something,” Harry muttered to the others
” “Can’t, Harry, sorry,” said Hagrid
 Harry noticed him glance at the fire
 Harry looked at it, too
 Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too
 Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid
” Harry whispered
 Harry didn’t like the look on Malfoy’s face at all
 Harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella
” Harry bolted to the door and looked out
 Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy’s face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous
 “Just let him go,” Harry urged
” “He’s lost his marbles,” Ron muttered in Harry’s ear
 “Hagrid,” said Harry loudly, “give it two weeks and Norbert’s going to be as long as your house
” Harry suddenly turned to Ron
 Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed
 Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry’s invisibility cloak
” said Harry, hurrying to let her in
 “We’ve got the invisibility cloak,” said Harry
 Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed
” Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down
” Harry and Hermione didn’t get a chance to answer
 “It’s too late to change the plan now,” Harry told Hermione
 Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn’t come quickly enough
” From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off
” Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves
 UP another staircase, then another – even one of Harry’s shortcuts didn’t make the work much easier
” Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower
 Harry Potter’s coming — he’s got a dragon
” “Don’t,” Harry advised her
 They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they’d rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them
 They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much
 HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE FORBIDDEN FOREST T hings couldn’t have been worse
 Excuses, alibis, and wild cover- up stories chased each other around Harry’s brain, each more feeble than the last
 Had Harry thought that things couldn’t have been worse
 “Harry
 “I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he said you had a drag—” Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall had seen
” Harry caught Neville’s eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn’t true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt
 Poor, blundering Neville — Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark, to warn them
” Harry gasped — they would lose the lead, the lead he’d won in the last Quidditch match
 Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach
 Harry didn’t sleep all night
 Harry couldn’t think of anything to say to comfort him
 And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lost them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years
 From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most hated
 Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn’t trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him
” said Harry miserably
 It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren’t his business from now on
 The rest of the team wouldn’t speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him “the Seeker
 They didn’t have as bad a time as Harry, because they weren’t as well-known, but nobody would speak to them, either
 Harry was almost glad that the exams weren’t far away
 Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry’s new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn’t concern him was put to an unexpected test
 Harry moved closer
 Harry didn’t think Quirrell had even noticed him
 Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he’d promised himself about not meddling
 All the same, he’d have gambled twelve Sorcerer’s Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step — Quirrell seemed to have given in at last
 Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy
 Harry told them what he’d heard
 So what do we do, Harry
” The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron’s eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could
” said Harry
 “If we just do a bit of poking around —” “No,” said Harry flatly, “we’ve done enough poking around
 The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table
 Professor McGonagall Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they’d lost
 Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they’d got
 Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too
 Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be
 Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid’s hut
” Harry’s heart rose
” Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry’s robe and made a choking noise
 All right, Harry, Hermione
 “I’m not going in that forest,” he said, and Harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice
 “So me, Harry, an’ Hermione’ll go one way an’ Draco, Neville, an’ Fang’ll go the other
 A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right
 Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried
” Harry asked
 Harry could hear running water
” Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak
” Harry suggested
 Harry and Hermione’s jaws dropped
 This is Harry Potter an’ Hermione Granger, by the way
” Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view
” said Harry
 Harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder
 Harry’s seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig
 Right, we’re changin’ groups — Neville, you stay with me an’ Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an’ this idiot
 I’m sorry,” Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, “but he’ll have a harder time frightenin’ you, an’ we’ve gotta get this done
” So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang
 Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker
 Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak
 Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad
 Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood
 Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed
 The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry — unicorn blood was dribbling down its front
 It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry — he couldn’t move for fear
 He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure
 The pain in Harry’s head was so bad he fell to his knees
” said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet
 He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry’s forehead
 “My name is Firenze,” he added, as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back
” Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on
 with Harry clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them
 Harry didn’t have a clue what was going on
” Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry’s question
 They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn’t want to talk to him anymore
 “Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for
” “No,” said Harry, startled by the odd question
” Harry stared at the back of Firenze’s head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight
” It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry’s heart
” “Do you mean,” Harry croaked, “that was Vol-” “Harry
 Harry, are you all right
 “I’m fine,” said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying
” Harry slid off his back
 “Good luck, Harry Potter,” said Firenze
” He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him
 He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake
 In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest
 Harry couldn’t sit down
 Harry wasn’t listening
 “So all I’ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,” Harry went on feverishly, “then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off 
 “Harry, everyone says Dumbledore’s the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of with Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won’t touch you
 When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them
 HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone CHAPTER SIXTEEN THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR I n years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment
 Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest
 Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn’t sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it
 Maybe it was because they hadn’t seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn’t have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn’t seem as worried about the Stone as Harry
 When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn’t help cheering with the rest
 “You could look more cheerful, Harry, we’ve got a week before we find out how badly we’ve done, there’s no need to worry yet
” Harry was rubbing his forehead
 “I’m not ill,” said Harry
 “Harry, relax, Hermione’s right, the Stone’s safe as long as Dumbledore’s around
” Harry nodded, but he couldn’t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he’d forgotten to do, something important
” Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have anything to do with work, though
 Harry suddenly jumped to his feet
 “I’ve just thought of something,” said Harry
 “Don’t you think it’s a bit odd,” said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, “that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket
” said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn’t answer
” “Yes, please,” said Ron, but Harry cut him off
” Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas
” Harry asked, trying to keep his voice calm
” Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn’t speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds
 “We’ve got to go to Dumbledore,” said Harry
 “We’ll just have to —” Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall
 “We want to see Professor Dumbledore,” said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought
” Harry swallowed — now what
” said Harry frantically
” “Look,” said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, “Professor — it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone —” Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn’t that
 “It’s tonight,” said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot
 Harry and Ron wheeled round
 “We were —” Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say
” Harry flushed
 Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others
 “And we’d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,” Harry told Ron
” Harry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, “At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,” when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in
 “I’m sorry, Harry
” Harry said
” “SO WHAT” Harry shouted
 “You’re right Harry,” said Hermione in a small voice
 “I’ll use the invisibility cloak,” said Harry
 none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all
 Harry and Ron didn’t talk much
 Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory
 “Nothing, Neville, nothing,” said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back
” Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door
” “You don’t understand,” said Harry, “this is important
” Harry turned to Hermione
” Harry whispered
” “We had to, Neville, no time to explain,” said Harry
 “Oh, let’s kick her, just this once,” Ron whispered in Harry’s ear, but Harry shook his head
” Harry had a sudden idea
” “I have business here, Peeves,” croaked Harry
 “Brilliant, Harry
 “Well, there you are,” Harry said quietly, “Snape’s already got past Fluffy
 Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two
 Harry pushed the door open
” “It must wake up the moment you stop playing,” said Harry
 Harry hardly drew breath
 “Keep playing,” Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor
” Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself
” Harry handed the flute over
 Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor
 “See you in a minute, I hope …” And Harry let go
 He landed, sprawled next to Harry
 She landed on Harry’s other side
 As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing
” Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest
” Harry choked
 “Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face
 “Yeah,” said Ron, “and lucky Harry doesn’t lose his head in a crisis — ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly
” “This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward
 The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts
 Harry listened
 “Probably,” said Harry
” Harry said suddenly
 Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century
” Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom
” Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing
” Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it
 it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand
 They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand
” Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle
 Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly – the towering white chessmen had no faces
” Harry whispered
” Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think
 Finally he said, “Now, don’t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess —” “We’re not offended,” said Harry quickly
” “Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you next to him instead of that castle
 The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took
 Harry’s knees were trembling
 “Harry — move diagonally four squares to the right
 Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger
” Harry and Hermione shouted
 I take one step forward and she’ll take me — that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry
 Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left
 The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry’s feet
 With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway
” “He’ll be all right,” said Harry, trying to convince himself
” Harry whispered
” Harry pushed it open
 “I’m glad we didn’t have to fight that one,” Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs
 “Snape’s,” said Harry
 Harry looked over her shoulder to read it: Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind, Two of us will help you, which ever you would find, One among us seven will let you move ahead, Another will transport the drinker back instead, Two among our number hold only nettle wine, Three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line
 Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing
” Harry looked at the tiny bottle
 “You drink that,” said Harry
” “But Harry — what if You-Know-Who’s with him
” said Harry, pointing at his scar
” Hermione’s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him
” “Harry — you’re a great wizard, you know
” “I’m not as good as you,” said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him
 There are more important things — friendship and bravery and — oh Harry — be careful
” “You drink first,” said Harry
” said Harry anxiously
 Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle
 HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE MAN WITH TWO FACES I t was Quirrell
” gasped Harry
” Harry couldn’t take it in
 Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry
” It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell
 “Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this…but he’s in London…I’ll be far away by the time he gets back…” All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror
” Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn’t give
” Harry gasped
 Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley — how could he have been so stupid
” Harry’s mind was racing
” And to Harry’s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself
…” Quirrell rounded on Harry
” He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off
 Harry got slowly to his feet
” Harry walked toward him
 Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell’s turban
 It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket — and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket
” Harry screwed up his courage
 As Harry moved aside, he felt the Sorcerer’s Stone against his leg
” “I have strength enough…for this…” Harry felt as if Devil’s Snare was rooting him to the spot
 Harry would have screamed, but he couldn’t make a sound
 Where there should have been a back to Quirrell’s head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen
 “Harry Potter…” it whispered
 Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn’t move
 The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry’s legs
” Harry shouted suddenly
” Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed “SEIZE HIM
” and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell’s hand close on his wrist
 At once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry’s scar
” shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet landing on top of him, both hands around Harry’s neck — Harry’s scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony
” And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms — Harry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny
 Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell’s face — “AAAARGH
” Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn’t touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain — his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse
 Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as he could
 Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off — the pain in Harry’s head was building — he couldn’t see — he could only hear Quirrell’s terrible shrieks and Voldemort’s yells of, “KILL HIM
” and other voices, maybe in Harry’s own head, crying, “Harry
 Harry
 “Good afternoon, Harry,” said Dumbledore
 Harry stared at him
 Sir, I —” “Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out
” Harry swallowed and looked around him
” said Harry blankly
” Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry’s face
” Harry lay there, lost for words
” said Harry
 “I’ve been thinking…sir — even if the Stone’s gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who —” “Call him Voldemort, Harry
” “No, Harry, he has not
 Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time — and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power
” Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt
 You will know, one day…put it from your mind for now, Harry
” And Harry knew it would be no good to argue
” Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet
 When he had found his voice again, Harry said, “And the invisibility cloak — do you know who sent it to me
” “Quirrell said Snape —” “Professor Snape, Harry
…” Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped
 “Just five minutes,” Harry pleaded
 “Harry
” Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore
 “Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to — Dumbledore was so worried —” “The whole school’s talking about it,” said Ron
 Harry told them everything: Quirrell
 they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell’s turban, Hermione screamed out loud
” said Harry
 “I brought Ron round — that took a while — and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall — he already knew — he just said, ‘Harry’s gone after him, hasn’t he
” “No, it isn’t,” said Harry thoughtfully
 After a good night’s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal
” “Oh, good,” said Harry
 He sat down next to Harry, took one look at him, and burst into tears
” said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard
” Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he stopped crying
” said Harry anxiously, and at last Hagrid gave a weak chuckle
 Harry opened it curiously
” Harry couldn’t speak, but Hagrid understood
 Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night
 When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once
 Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table
 Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears
 Harry Potter…” said Dumbledore
 They had tied for the house cup — if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point
 Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him
 Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn’t have looked more stunned and horrified if he’d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him
 He caught Harry’s eye and Harry knew at once that Snape’s feelings toward him hadn’t changed one jot
 This didn’t worry Harry
 It was the best evening of Harry’s life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls…he would never, ever forget tonight
 Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did
” “Thanks,” said Harry, “I’ll need something to look forward to
 Some of them called: “Bye, Harry
 “Not where I’m going, I promise you,” said Harry
 “Harry Potter
 “Very,” said Harry
” It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people
 Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry
 “You must be Harry’s family
 Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione
 “Oh, I will,” said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face
